[codeship]: https://codeship.com/projects/2f7177d0-9fe4-0132-4781-161c16488463/status?branch=master "Codeship Badge"

## Full solution for frontend project startup
* Grunt for automation
* browserify for nodejs style require and module.exports
* sass compiling
* BrowserSync and grunt-watch for serving and live-reload (with re-compilation)
* testem framework with Mocha and Chai  
* tests works with require due to some magic

## Usage
    
    //install dependencies
    npm install
    //run the tests
    npm install -g testem
    testem
    //or
    grunt test
    //run in dev mode
    grunt dev

# Remarks
#### If you're using tmux, 
##### you should run:

    brew install reattach-to-user-namespace

and add the following line to the .tmux.conf file:

    set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l bash"
